RAG model that will rank jobs based on resume provided where the candidate will be a good fit 

I'll help you design a comprehensive RAG system for resume-job matching. Here's a detailed breakdown of the optimal tech stack and architecture:

## Core Architecture

**RAG Pipeline Components:**
1. **Document Processing** → **Vector Embedding** → **Vector Storage** → **Retrieval** → **Ranking/Scoring** → **Response Generation**

## Vector Embedding Models

**Primary Recommendation: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**
- **Why:** Specifically fine-tuned for semantic similarity tasks
- **Advantages:** Fast inference, good balance of performance/speed, 384-dimensional embeddings
- **Alternative:** `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` (higher quality, slower)

**For Production Scale: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`**
- **Why:** Superior semantic understanding, especially for professional documents
- **Advantages:** 1536 dimensions, excellent at capturing nuanced job requirements
- **Cost:** ~$0.02 per 1M tokens

## Vector Database

**Primary Choice: Pinecone**
- **Why:** Purpose-built for similarity search with excellent performance
- **Advantages:** 
  - Sub-100ms query times
  - Built-in metadata filtering
  - Auto-scaling
  - Excellent Python SDK
- **Alternative:** Weaviate (open-source, self-hosted option)

**Budget Alternative: FAISS + PostgreSQL**
- **Why:** Cost-effective for smaller datasets (<100K job descriptions)
- **Advantages:** Free, integrates with existing SQL infrastructure

## Language Model for Ranking/Scoring

**Recommendation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4**
- **Why:** Superior reasoning for complex matching decisions
- **Use case:** Final re-ranking of top candidates with detailed explanations
- **Alternative:** Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B for cost efficiency

## Document Processing Stack

**Text Extraction:**
- **PyMuPDF** for PDF resumes
- **python-docx** for Word documents
- **BeautifulSoup4** for HTML/web-scraped job postings

**Text Preprocessing:**
- **spaCy** with `en_core_web_sm` model
- **Why:** Excellent NER for extracting skills, companies, roles

## Implementation Framework

**Backend:** FastAPI
- **Why:** Async support, automatic API docs, excellent performance
- **Alternative:** Flask (simpler but less performant)

**Orchestration:** LangChain
- **Why:** Built-in RAG patterns, easy model switching
- **Alternative:** LlamaIndex (better for complex document structures)

## Database Schema

**Main Database: PostgreSQL**
```sql
-- Store original documents
resumes: id, content, metadata, created_at
jobs: id, title, company, description, requirements, created_at

-- Store embeddings (if not using dedicated vector DB)
embeddings: document_id, vector, document_type
```

## Recommended Architecture Flow

1. **Ingestion Pipeline:**
   - Extract text from resume/job descriptions
   - Clean and normalize text
   - Generate embeddings using sentence-transformers
   - Store in Pinecone with metadata

2. **Retrieval Pipeline:**
   - Convert resume to embedding
   - Query Pinecone for top 50 similar jobs
   - Use metadata filtering (location, salary range, etc.)

3. **Ranking Pipeline:**
   - Pass top 50 candidates to LLM
   - Generate detailed matching scores
   - Return top 10 with explanations

## Why This Stack Beats Alternatives

**vs. Traditional ML (TF-IDF, etc.):**
- Captures semantic meaning, not just keyword matching
- Understands "Python developer" matches "Software Engineer"

**vs. Simple Cosine Similarity:**
- LLM re-ranking catches nuanced requirements
- Can weigh different factors (experience level, skills, culture fit)

**vs. All-LLM Solution:**
- Much faster and cheaper
- Vector search handles bulk filtering efficiently
- LLM only processes most relevant candidates

**vs. Elasticsearch:**
- Better semantic search capabilities
- Purpose-built for embedding similarity
- Easier to scale for real-time applications

## Performance Expectations

- **Query Time:** <500ms for top 10 results
- **Accuracy:** 85-90% relevant matches in top 10
- **Scalability:** Handle 100K+ job descriptions efficiently

## Cost Estimates (per 1000 queries)

- **Pinecone:** ~$0.10
- **OpenAI Embeddings:** ~$0.05
- **Claude/GPT-4 Re-ranking:** ~$2-5
- **Total:** ~$3-6 per 1000 resume matches
